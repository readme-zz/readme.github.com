summary: This is my first post using Github and Jekyll

This is an experiment. If it works out I will begin publishing on Github.

I have lots of experience with complicated content management systems. This is different. The documents are written in plain text on my computer, then saved and published to a folder on Github.com. After that, they're auto-magically transformed from text into web pages.

If it works, I'm going to be very happy.
