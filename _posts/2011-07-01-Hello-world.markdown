This is an experiment. If it works out I will begin publishing on Github.

I have lots of experience with complicated content management systems. This is different. The documents are written in plain text on my computer, then saved and published to a folder on Github.com. After that, they're auto-magically transformed from text into web pages.

The setup, unfortunately, has a pretty steep learning curve, but I'm going to be very, very happy if it works.

Thanks to those who have gone before, making this easier for me, especially <a href="http://johnsonpage.org">Johnson Page</a>, who figured out how to use Blueprint with Github and Jekyll.
