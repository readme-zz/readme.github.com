# About Me

I'm Johnson Page, a web application developer in Brisbane, Australia. 

I write software for the web, previously launching two major applications for Telstra: [Whereis Everyone](http://everyone.whereis.com) and [Bigpond Callertones for Facebook](http://fb.ctones.telstra.com) with [Locatrix Communications](http://locatrix.com). I've also developed complex customer relationship management software for the international business coaching franchise [ActionCOACH](http://actioncoach.com). 

This year I participated in the 2010 Rails Rumble, where I designed, wrote and launched [Oh Kan Ban](http://ohkanban.com/), a simple task management tool -- all within 48 hours!

I'm proficient in developing web applications using __XHTML__, __JavaScript__ and __CSS__. I most often work with __PHP__, but reguarly dip my toes into the worlds of __Ruby__, __Python__ and __Java__ (for Android development). I publish some of my open-source code on [Github](http://github.com/jwpage).

In order to write quality code, I follow best practices in software development, such as unit testing, continuous integration, and the creation of comprehensive documentation and am always looking to improve and enhance my skillset.

When I'm not messing around with code I enjoy cooking, listening to music and the odd dose of science fiction.
