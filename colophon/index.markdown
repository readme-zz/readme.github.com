# Colophon --- About This Site

The layout of this website is written in HTML5 with CSS and a touch of JavaScript. The design is written on top of the [Blueprint CSS Framework](http://www.blueprintcss.org/) and the JavaScript lies on top of the solid [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) JavaScript framework.

The blog engine behind the content, as the footer points out, is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). The Jekyll website sums it up quite nicely:

> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server.

All the code and content for this blog can be found [on Github](http://github.com/jwpage/johnsonpage-blog).

This website is hosted on [Rackspace Cloud](http://www.rackspacecloud.com), a cloud-based web host. Rackspace Cloud lets me run and manage a low-cost server, paying for only what I use. By hosting off Rackspace Cloud I don't have to worry about any shared-hosting gotchas. Any package I need, I can install.
